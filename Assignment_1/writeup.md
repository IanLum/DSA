Writing code in Kotlin wasn't too bad. It had the typical getting used to syntax of learning a new language, but nothing especially difficult. I enjoy Kotlin being staticly typed and requiring type annotations for function arguments and return values. The main thing I ran into trouble with was Chars and Strings being different types, especially as I was translating code from Python. For example, you can add Strings to Strings, and Chars to Strings, but you can't add Chars to Chars. I also ran into trouble trying to print the type of a variable, which I learned you do via `::class.java.typeName`.
