1. What features do you like about Kotlin?
I enjoy Kotlin being staticly typed and requiring type annotations for function arguments and return values. 
2. Are there things you were expecting to find that you havenâ€™t?
Not really, to be fair there wasn't anything in particular I was expecting, but nothing seemed to be missing.
3. What questions do you have?
I was wondering what setup is required to get Kotlin working in vscode, or if I should just stick with intellij.

<ins> Translating Code </ins>
Writing code in Kotlin wasn't too bad. It had the typical getting used to syntax of learning a new language, but nothing especially difficult. The main thing I ran into trouble with was Chars and Strings being different types, especially as I was translating code from Python. For example, you can add Strings to Strings, and Chars to Strings, but you can't add Chars to Chars. I also ran into trouble trying to print the type of a variable, which I learned you do via `::class.java.typeName`. I also had some issues with setting up unit tests, but found out the issue was not creating a seperate project, and got it all working in the end.
